# Advanced Table Component for Vue 3 + TypeScript

A highly customizable and performant table component built with Vue 3 and TypeScript, designed for large datasets and rich user interactions. The component is based on Element Plus or Ant Design Vue for enhanced functionality.

## Features

- **Multi-level headers**: Supports hierarchical table headers.
- **Customizable fixed columns**: Allow users to define fixed columns on the left or right.
- **Drag-and-drop row reordering**: Enables users to rearrange rows by dragging.
- **Custom table structure**: Fully customizable table layout and behavior.
- **Selectable rows**: Supports both single and multiple row selection modes.
- **Configurable row numbering**: Allows toggling the display of row indices.
- **Merged cells**: Supports merging identical cell values in both rows and columns.
- **Excel import with validation**: Supports data import from Excel files and validates data against predefined regex rules.  
  If validation fails, an error message (e.g., **‚Äúxx data is required or has an invalid format‚Äù**) is displayed.
- **Virtual scrolling for large datasets**: Handles large data volumes (e.g., 10,000 rows) efficiently by rendering only visible rows, improving performance. Merged cells are also considered in virtual scrolling.

This component is optimized for performance and flexibility, making it suitable for complex data-intensive applications. üöÄ
